    The article from Marketfit Lab Solutions discusses the transition from Google Analytics Universal Analytics (GA UA) to Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and compares GA4 with Mixpanel, focusing on their capabilities in enhancing business performance through data analytics. GA4, introduced by Google, shifts from a "pageview" and "session"-based data collection to an "event"-based model, reflecting the growing importance of mobile applications and the need for cross-platform analysis. This transition aims to provide deeper insights into user behavior across web and mobile platforms.

    However, the article points out that many businesses find GA4's user interface and experience challenging, leading them to consider alternatives like Mixpanel. Mixpanel, established in 2009, has been a pioneer in event analytics, offering a stable and user-friendly platform. Its intuitive UI/UX allows teams to easily adapt and focus on data-driven decision-making without the steep learning curve associated with GA4.
    
    One of Mixpanel's strengths is its flexible dashboard customization. Unlike GA4's fixed data structures, Mixpanel enables companies to tailor dashboards to their specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and sub-KPIs. This customization facilitates focused analysis on metrics that directly impact revenue, marketing efficiency, and product funnel optimization. Teams can create and modify dashboards to align with their strategic objectives, ensuring that critical data is readily accessible for informed decision-making.
    
    Another significant advantage of Mixpanel is its real-time data collection. While GA4 may experience delays of 24 to 48 hours and often resorts to data sampling, Mixpanel provides immediate access to unsampled, real-time data. This immediacy is crucial for businesses aiming to respond swiftly to market changes, optimize marketing campaigns, and enhance user engagement strategies. Real-time insights allow for prompt adjustments to marketing tactics, leading to improved conversion rates and customer retention.
    
    Mixpanel also excels in in-depth and diverse data analysis. Its event-based tracking system offers detailed insights into user behavior, enabling businesses to identify patterns and trends that inform product development and marketing strategies. For instance, product managers can analyze user interactions before and after the launch of a new feature, such as a redesigned shopping cart page, to assess its impact on user engagement and conversion rates. This level of analysis supports continuous product optimization and enhances the overall user experience.
    
    In summary, the article highlights that while GA4 represents a significant shift towards event-based analytics, its complexity and user experience challenges have led many businesses to adopt Mixpanel. Mixpanel's flexible dashboards, real-time data processing, and comprehensive analytical capabilities make it a valuable tool for improving business performance. By leveraging Mixpanel's strengths, companies can enhance their marketing efficiency, increase website traffic, optimize product funnels, and ultimately drive revenue growth.

    The article from Marketfit Lab Solutions outlines five primary reasons organizations adopt Mixpanel as their product analytics tool, aiming to enhance business performance through improved data accessibility, marketing analysis, real-time monitoring, cohort analysis, and identification of key user engagement moments.

    **1. Enhancing Data Accessibility**
    
    Prior to implementing Mixpanel, many organizations relied on data teams or engineers to extract product-related metrics, leading to bottlenecks and delays in decision-making. Mixpanel's intuitive interface democratizes data access, enabling non-technical team members to retrieve and analyze data independently. This shift reduces the time required to obtain insights from weeks to minutes, facilitating more frequent and informed data-driven decisions.
    
    **2. Marketing Analysis and Inflow Tracking**
    
    Marketing teams often spearhead the adoption of Mixpanel to gain deeper insights into user acquisition channels and campaign performance. Mixpanel allows businesses to monitor conversion rates and retention metrics across various channels and campaigns. By automatically capturing UTM parameters, Mixpanel identifies the source and medium of web traffic, enabling detailed analysis of user journeys and the effectiveness of marketing efforts. For mobile applications, integrating a Mobile Measurement Partner (MMP) tool is recommended to track acquisition channels accurately.
    
    **3. Real-Time Metrics Monitoring**
    
    Organizations seek to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Monthly Active Users (MAU), Daily Active Users (DAU), activation rates, and retention rates in real-time. Mixpanel's dashboard functionality allows stakeholders to create and share customized dashboards, ensuring that critical metrics are readily accessible for timely decision-making. This real-time visibility into performance metrics enables teams to respond swiftly to emerging trends and issues, thereby improving overall business agility.
    
    **4. Cohort Analysis for Targeted Insights**
    
    Understanding user behavior across different segments is crucial for product optimization. Mixpanel offers robust cohort analysis features, allowing organizations to define and analyze user groups based on various criteria such as lifecycle stages (e.g., new, active, dormant users). This capability enables businesses to monitor trends, compare behaviors across segments, and tailor strategies to specific user groups, ultimately enhancing user engagement and retention.
    
    **5. Identifying 'Aha' Moments**
    
    Recognizing the critical points where users realize the value of a product—termed 'Aha' moments—is vital for driving engagement and retention. Mixpanel facilitates the discovery of these moments through advanced analysis tools like funnel and retention analysis, as well as the Signal report, which identifies correlations between user actions and retention metrics. By pinpointing these key interactions, organizations can optimize user onboarding and product features to replicate and enhance these pivotal experiences.
    
    In conclusion, the adoption of Mixpanel empowers organizations to make data-driven decisions that directly impact revenue growth, marketing efficiency, user acquisition, and product optimization. By improving data accessibility and providing comprehensive analytical capabilities, Mixpanel serves as a catalyst for business performance enhancement.

By focusing on high-value cohorts, they implemented tailored retention strategies, such as exclusive offers and personalized product recommendations, which resulted in improved customer loyalty and repeat purchases.
    
    **3. Streamlining the Purchase Funnel**
    
    Mixpanel's funnel analysis provided insights into drop-off points within the purchase process. The data indicated that a significant number of users abandoned their carts at the payment stage. In response, the company simplified the checkout process and introduced multiple payment options. These changes reduced friction, leading to a smoother user experience and a substantial increase in completed transactions.
    
    **4. Real-Time Performance Monitoring**
    
    With Mixpanel's real-time analytics, the team monitored the impact of their changes instantaneously. This capability allowed for agile decision-making and rapid iteration of strategies. For example, A/B testing of different promotional offers was conducted, and the results were analyzed in real-time to identify the most effective approach. This iterative process ensured continuous optimization of marketing efforts and user engagement tactics.
    
    **5. Data-Driven Product Development**
    
    Insights from Mixpanel informed the development of new features aligned with user preferences and behaviors. For instance, data showed a growing trend of mobile users, prompting the company to enhance their mobile app experience. This focus on mobile optimization led to increased mobile transactions, contributing to overall revenue growth.

    The article from Marketfit Lab Solutions provides an advanced guide on utilizing Mixpanel's Flow Report to analyze user behavior patterns, offering actionable insights to enhance business performance.

    **1. Setting Aggregation Criteria with Conversion Criteria**
    
    Mixpanel's Flow Report allows businesses to define aggregation criteria through the Conversion Criteria feature, determining how user actions are counted. The default setting is 'Uniques,' focusing on distinct users. Alternatively, 'Total' counts all occurrences of events, and 'Sessions' groups actions within the same session. Understanding these distinctions enables companies to tailor analyses to specific objectives, such as tracking individual user engagement or overall event frequency.
    
    **2. Defining Conversion Windows**
    
    The Conversion Window feature specifies the timeframe within which users must complete a sequence of actions. The default is 30 days, but businesses can adjust this period to align with their sales cycles or campaign durations. For example, an e-commerce company might set a shorter conversion window to evaluate the effectiveness of a limited-time promotion, ensuring timely insights into user behavior.
    
    **3. Maintaining Consistent Properties with Hold Property Constant**
    
    The 'Hold Property Constant' function ensures that analyses focus on events sharing specific attributes, such as product ID or campaign source. This consistency is crucial for evaluating the performance of particular products or marketing channels. For instance, by holding the 'item ID' constant, a retailer can assess the user journey for a specific product, identifying drop-off points and opportunities for conversion rate optimization.
    
    **4. Cohort Segmentation and Comparison**
    
    Mixpanel enables segmentation of users into cohorts based on defined criteria, facilitating comparative analysis of different user groups. By applying cohorts like 'Android Users' and 'iOS Users,' businesses can visualize distinct behavioral patterns and tailor strategies accordingly. This segmentation supports targeted marketing efforts and personalized user experiences, leading to improved retention and increased lifetime value.
    
    **5. Filtering Out Noise with Hide Events**
    
    To focus on critical user actions, the 'Hide Events' feature allows the exclusion of non-essential events from analysis. This streamlines reports, highlighting significant behaviors that impact key performance indicators. For example, by hiding background processes or less relevant interactions, a company can concentrate on events directly influencing conversion rates, such as 'Add to Cart' or 'Purchase Completed.'
    
    **6. Utilizing Custom Events in Reports**
    
    Custom events enable the grouping of multiple actions into a single event for cohesive analysis. This is particularly useful for tracking complex user journeys involving various interactions. For example, combining 'Sign Up' and 'Profile Completion' into a 'User Onboarding' event allows businesses to monitor the overall onboarding process efficiency, identifying areas for improvement to enhance user activation rates.
    
    By mastering these advanced features of Mixpanel's Flow Report, businesses can gain deeper insights into user behavior, leading to data-driven decisions that enhance marketing efficiency, optimize product funnels, and ultimately drive revenue growth.

  description: |
    The article discusses the importance of defining appropriate product metrics and organizing them into a clear framework for businesses. It emphasizes that there is no one-size-fits-all metric for every product, as each business and product has unique goals. For example, an e-commerce startup may focus on acquiring new customers quickly, while a large, established bank may prioritize customer retention and upselling. The key takeaway is the development of a metric hierarchy, starting with a "focus metric," followed by level 1 and level 2 metrics, each serving to guide and measure the performance of the product. This hierarchical system helps businesses align team actions with overall company goals, ensuring efficient performance tracking. The article also advocates for using multiple key performance indicators (KPIs) instead of focusing solely on one "North Star" metric, as this can lead to undesirable outcomes, such as sacrificing user experience.The article discusses the importance of defining appropriate product metrics and organizing them into a clear framework for businesses.

    The article from Marketfit Lab Solutions discusses the integration of Mixpanel and Braze to enhance CRM marketing through personalized user engagement. By combining Mixpanel's in-depth product analytics with Braze's multi-channel messaging capabilities, businesses can create highly targeted marketing campaigns that improve user retention and conversion rates.

    **1. Enhancing Retention with Targeted Push Notifications**
    
    A music streaming service, referred to as Music Finder, faced challenges with declining user retention, particularly among users acquired through referral and Facebook channels. Utilizing Mixpanel's Retention Reports, the marketing team identified a significant drop in song play activity during the tenth week for these user segments. To address this, they created specific cohorts of at-risk users within Mixpanel and seamlessly exported these cohorts to Braze. Braze then facilitated the delivery of personalized push notifications, encouraging users to re-engage with the app. This targeted approach led to a measurable increase in user retention rates among the specified cohorts.
    
    **2. Accurate Campaign Performance Analysis**
    
    While Braze provides metrics on campaign performance, integrating it with Mixpanel allows for a more granular analysis of user behavior post-engagement. By transmitting Braze's campaign data to Mixpanel through Braze's Currents feature, the marketing team could construct detailed funnel reports. This integration enabled them to track direct conversions resulting from specific campaigns within defined sessions, offering a clearer picture of campaign effectiveness and informing future marketing strategies.
    
    **3. Analyzing User Experience Flows Post-Campaign**
    
    Understanding the user journey after interacting with a campaign is crucial for optimizing the overall user experience. Through the integration, Mixpanel's Flow Reports provided insights into the paths users took after engaging with Braze's push notifications. For instance, after an "Early Bird Renewal" campaign, the team observed that users often navigated to the homepage before accessing the pricing plan page. This insight prompted a redesign of the notification's deep link, directing users straight to the intended page, thereby streamlining the user journey and enhancing conversion rates.
    
    In summary, the integration of Mixpanel and Braze empowers businesses to execute data-driven, personalized marketing campaigns. This synergy not only enhances user engagement and retention but also provides comprehensive analytics to refine marketing strategies continually.

    **2. Session02: TMAP's Foray into the Chauffeur Service Market**
    
    Shin Woo-young, a planner for TMAP's chauffeur service, discussed the challenges of entering a market dominated by established players. Despite an initial market share of 0.3% and a 20% ride completion rate, the team utilized Mixpanel to analyze driver and customer locations. They discovered that cancellations increased significantly when drivers were more than 800 meters away from customers. By optimizing matching algorithms to prioritize closer drivers, they improved customer satisfaction. Further analysis showed that customers completing three rides had a 90% likelihood of returning post-promotion, leading to targeted strategies like offering '3-combo' coupons to new users. Additionally, data revealed that cash-paying customers, after completing two rides, exhibited higher conversion rates than those using digital payments. This finding prompted the introduction of incentives for cash users, enhancing loyalty and retention.
    
    These sessions underscore the importance of leveraging data analytics tools like Mixpanel to identify user behavior patterns and inform strategic decisions, ultimately driving business growth and overcoming periods of stagnation.

    4. **Search Console Data Export Setup**: In the Search Console interface, users select the property to export, navigate to Settings > Bulk Data Export, and configure the export destination by entering the Google Cloud Project ID and selecting the desired dataset location.
    
    Once configured, data begins populating in BigQuery within 48 hours, with daily updates thereafter. The exported data is organized into three primary tables: ExportLog, which details export operations; searchdata_site_impression, providing performance metrics at the site level; and searchdata_url_impression, offering granular insights at the URL level.
    
    By leveraging this integration, businesses can perform in-depth analyses of search queries, user engagement, and content performance, leading to more informed decision-making and optimized marketing strategies. This approach not only overcomes the inherent limitations of Search Console but also empowers organizations to harness their search data for sustained business growth.

    The article "Understanding GA4 E-commerce Metrics and Dimensions" from Open Source Marketing discusses the implementation and analysis of e-commerce events in Google Analytics 4 (GA4). It emphasizes the importance of correctly setting up recommended e-commerce events such as purchase, add_to_cart, and view_item, along with their associated parameters, to effectively track user interactions and product information.
    
    A key concept introduced is the 'items' parameter, which allows for the collection of detailed product information in an array format. This is particularly useful when a single event, like a purchase, involves multiple products. The 'items' array can include various attributes such as item_id, item_name, item_brand, item_category, price, and quantity, among others. Accurately capturing these details enables more granular analysis of product performance and user behavior.
    
    The article also highlights the distinction between event-level parameters and item-level details, noting that while event parameters like transaction_id and value are associated with the overall event, the 'items' array provides specifics about each product involved. Understanding this structure is crucial for setting up meaningful reports and analyses in GA4.
    
    In terms of reporting, GA4 offers predefined metrics and dimensions related to e-commerce, accessible through the Explorations feature. However, users should be aware of potential discrepancies in naming conventions, especially in translated interfaces, to ensure accurate data interpretation. By effectively implementing and analyzing these e-commerce events and parameters, businesses can gain deeper insights into their sales processes, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance overall performance.

    The article from Open Source Marketing provides a detailed guide on integrating Google Analytics 4 (GA4) with Google Search Console to monitor organic search performance. It highlights that, unlike Universal Analytics, GA4 now supports Search Console integration, enabling users to access organic search data directly within GA4. To establish this connection, users must have 'Editor' permissions in GA4 and 'Owner' permissions in Search Console. The process begins by accessing the 'Admin' section in GA4, selecting 'Search Console Links' under the 'Property' column, and initiating a new link. Users then choose the appropriate Search Console property and the corresponding GA4 web stream, completing the setup by submitting the configuration. Once linked, it's advisable to wait approximately 24 hours for data synchronization before proceeding. To visualize Search Console data within GA4, users should navigate to the 'Reports' section, access the 'Library' at the bottom, and publish the 'Search Console' collection. This action adds the Search Console reports to the main navigation, allowing users to analyze organic search queries and landing pages directly in GA4. The 'Queries' report displays search terms that led users to the site, while the 'Google Organic Search Traffic' report shows the landing pages through which users arrived. It's important to note that Search Console data is not real-time; there's a two-day delay, and data retention spans 16 months. Integrating these tools streamlines the analysis process, eliminating the need to switch platforms and providing a cohesive view of website performance. By leveraging this integration, businesses can enhance their understanding of organic search metrics, leading to informed decisions that can improve marketing strategies and overall business performance.

    The article from Open Source Marketing discusses the impending phase-out of third-party cookies and its significant impact on digital marketing strategies. Third-party cookies have been instrumental in enabling personalized advertising, automatic logins, and tailored content by tracking user behavior across websites. Their removal is primarily driven by growing concerns over user privacy, unconsented data collection, and the misuse of personal information. The absence of these cookies is expected to hinder personalized targeting capabilities, leading to increased advertising costs and reduced efficiency, with projections indicating a potential 10-20% rise in ad expenditures. To navigate this transition, the article recommends several strategies:

    1. **Implementing User Consent Mechanisms**: Establishing systems that request and manage user consent for data collection, ensuring compliance with evolving privacy regulations.
    
    2. **Search Engine Marketing (SEM)**: Shifting focus to SEM, particularly search ads, which align with user intent and often yield higher conversion rates compared to display ads.
    
    3. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**: Enhancing website structure and content to improve organic search visibility, thereby attracting users without relying on third-party data.
    
    4. **Customer Retention Strategies**: Developing initiatives to encourage repeat visits and foster loyalty, such as regular promotions or engagement activities, to mitigate the challenges of identifying returning users in a cookieless environment.
    
    5. **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems**: Building robust CRM pipelines to systematically manage customer interactions, including automated reminders and personalized communications, to maintain engagement and satisfaction.
    
    By proactively adopting these approaches, businesses can adapt to the evolving digital landscape, maintain effective marketing practices, and continue to deliver personalized experiences despite the decline of third-party cookies.

    The article from Open Source Marketing delves into the characteristics of display advertising (DA), emphasizing its proactive approach in reaching customers. Unlike search ads that appear based on user intent through specific keyword searches, display ads are presented to users regardless of their immediate intentions, often while they are consuming other content. This necessitates that marketers design display ads with strategies that enhance brand awareness and capture user interest. The article suggests focusing on three key areas:

    1. **Enhancing Brand Awareness**: Since users may not be familiar with the product, it's crucial to create ads that educate and inform, aiming to increase recognition and understanding before prompting a purchase.
    
    2. **Stimulating Interest**: Given that display ads can be perceived as interruptions, it's important to craft engaging and intriguing content that resonates with users, transforming potential annoyance into curiosity.
    
    3. **Optimizing for Ad Placement**: Tailoring ad creatives to fit the specific characteristics of their placement ensures better user experience and effectiveness. This includes adapting to various platforms such as Kakao Bizboard, Naver Performance Ads, Facebook, Instagram, and Google Display Network, each with its unique format and audience.
    
    By aligning display advertising strategies with these considerations, businesses can effectively reach out to potential customers, foster interest, and ultimately drive conversions.

  description: |
    The article from Open Source Marketing provides an in-depth analysis of the `users_YYYYMMDD` and `pseudonymous_users_YYYYMMDD` tables in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) when exported to BigQuery. The `users_YYYYMMDD` table stores daily data of logged-in users, focusing on user attributes such as first and last visit dates, device and location information, and audience membership details. In contrast, the `pseudonymous_users_YYYYMMDD` table captures data based on client IDs or app instance IDs, encompassing all users regardless of login status, thus offering comprehensive insights into overall user interactions. Both tables share similar structures but differ in their user identification methods. Key fields in these tables include user identification details (`user_id` for logged-in users and `pseudo_user_id` for all users), user information (e.g., `user_info.last_active_timestamp_micros`), device specifics (e.g., `device.operating_system`), geolocation data (e.g., `geo.city`), audience information (e.g., `audiences.id`), user properties (e.g., `user_properties.key`), lifetime value metrics (e.g., `user_ltv.revenue_in_usd`), and predictive analytics scores (e.g., `predictions.purchase_score_7d`). Understanding these tables and their fields is crucial for conducting detailed user behavior analysis and enhancing marketing strategies based on GA4 data exported to BigQuery.

It explains that GA4 allows for the creation of segments based on users, sessions, and events, offering more detailed analysis compared to UA. The article also introduces the concept of predictive audiences in GA4, enabling the identification of users likely to perform specific actions, such as making a purchase within seven days. Additionally, it provides a step-by-step guide on creating segments in GA4's exploration reports, emphasizing the importance of understanding the differences between user, session, and event-based segments to ensure accurate data analysis.  

- url: https://osoma.kr/blog/canonical-url
  description: |
    The article from Open Source Marketing emphasizes the critical role of canonical URLs in SEO, particularly concerning indexing and content marketing. Canonical URLs, defined through the `<link rel="canonical" href="{URL}">` tag, address duplicate content issues by signaling to search engines the original source of content, thereby preventing potential SEO penalties. Additionally, the `<meta property="og:url" content="{URL}">` tag ensures accurate representation when content is shared on social media platforms, aligning social sharing with SEO strategies. Common challenges include URL parameters from tracking codes or filtering options, which can inadvertently create duplicate content. For instance, URLs like `https://osoma.kr/blog?utm_source=naver` or `https://osoma.kr/product?cate=cosmetics` may lead to multiple versions of the same content. To mitigate this, it's essential to set the canonical tag to the primary URL, guiding search engines to the preferred version. Errors such as incorrect canonical tags pointing to the wrong URLs or multiple canonical tags on a single page can confuse search engines, leading to indexing issues. Ensuring each page has a unique canonical tag that accurately reflects its URL is vital. In the absence of canonical tags, search engines might misinterpret duplicate content, potentially impacting search rankings. Therefore, implementing correct canonical tags is a fundamental step in optimizing a website's SEO performance.

  description: |
    The article from Open Source Marketing discusses the significance of `page_view` and `screen_view` events in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) for tracking user interactions on websites and mobile applications. Both events monitor 'views,' but `page_view` pertains to web page views, while `screen_view` relates to mobile app screen views. The `page_view` event triggers upon page load or browser history changes, capturing parameters like `page_title`, `page_location`, and `page_referrer`. Conversely, the `screen_view` event activates during app screen transitions, collecting data such as `firebase_screen`, `firebase_screen_class`, and `firebase_screen_id`. Understanding these events is crucial for analyzing user navigation paths and optimizing engagement strategies across platforms. GA4's reporting integrates both events, allowing comprehensive insights into user behavior on websites and mobile apps. Accurate implementation and analysis of these events enable businesses to enhance user experience and drive better marketing outcomes. citeturn0search0

    UTM parameters serve as tracking tags in URLs that allow marketers to monitor campaign performance and analyze user behavior through tools like Google Analytics 4. UTM stands for Urchin Tracking Module, named after the company Google acquired to develop Google Analytics, and has a long history as a verified starting point for traffic analysis. UTM parameters are added to URL query parameters, enabling the tracking of marketing campaign effectiveness by identifying traffic sources and user interactions with websites. When properly implemented, UTM parameters dramatically improve marketing analysis by allowing teams to track which campaigns generate traffic and conversions, analyze user behavior based on traffic sources, and optimize marketing activities through data-driven decision-making. GA4 supports nine UTM parameters: utm_id (Campaign ID), utm_source (traffic source identification), utm_medium (traffic source type), utm_campaign (campaign name), utm_content (creative material identification), utm_term (keyword information), utm_creative_format (creative format type), utm_source_platform (detailed platform information), and utm_marketing_tactic (marketing goal information). For effective UTM implementation, source and medium parameters should align with GA4's default channel groups and be written in lowercase English, while campaign names can be written in any language for clarity. Specific UTM implementation examples include Naver search ads (utm_source=naver&utm_medium=cpc), Facebook/Instagram ads using dynamic parameters, SMS links (utm_medium=sms), mobile push notifications (utm_medium=notification), social media posts (utm_medium=social), email newsletters (utm_medium=email), and display ads (utm_medium=display). Proper UTM usage requires understanding URL structure, where UTM parameters are added after the question mark (?) as query parameters, with multiple parameters connected by ampersands (&). For URLs that already contain a question mark, parameters should be added with an ampersand. Common UTM implementation practices include keeping utm_source values consistent with accurate platform names, ensuring utm_medium matches GA4 channel groupings, using descriptive campaign names in utm_campaign, and utilizing utm_content for differentiating marketing materials. The implementation of GA4-specific parameters like utm_creative_format (video, image, text, carousel), utm_source_platform (blog, cafe, shopping, feed), and utm_marketing_tactic (newsletter, CRM, promotions) allows for more granular performance analysis across different content types, platforms, and marketing strategies. Tools like Google's URL Builder and spreadsheet templates can help prevent errors in UTM creation and management. Using URL shorteners does not lose UTM information despite redirection, and writing UTM parameters in non-Latin scripts like Korean works properly as browsers handle the encoding and decoding process transparently. While not mandatory to use all UTM parameters, implementing at least source, medium, and campaign is recommended to avoid "(not set)" values in analytics and enable more detailed traffic analysis. The order of UTM parameters does not affect functionality, but maintaining a consistent order helps prevent confusion when creating and analyzing tracking links.

    BigQuery is a data warehouse service offered by Google Cloud Platform that allows users to store, manage, and analyze data using SQL queries. Its importance in the analytics field is increasing due to limitations in GA4 data access, particularly with the implementation of data thresholds and GA4 API quota limitations. Connecting GA4 to BigQuery enables businesses to overcome these constraints and gain deeper insights from their analytics data. To begin using BigQuery with GA4, users must first create a BigQuery account through Google Cloud Platform by logging in with their Google account, agreeing to service terms, entering customer information, providing payment details, and setting up a project. After account creation, connecting GA4 to BigQuery requires navigating to the GA4 Admin section, clicking on Product Links and then BigQuery Link, selecting Connect, choosing the appropriate BigQuery project, specifying the data storage location (preferably in the region where the service operates), setting the data export frequency (daily or streaming, with streaming incurring additional costs of $0.05 per GB or $0.06 in the Seoul region), and deciding whether to include user data exports. Once the connection is established, GA4 data begins flowing into BigQuery in various table formats: events_YYYYMMDD tables contain daily event data, events_intraday_YYYYMMDD tables hold streaming data that gets deleted once the daily table is complete, pseudonymous_users_YYYYMMDD tables store user data collected via anonymous identifiers (Client ID, App Instance ID), and users_YYYYMMDD tables contain user data based on user_id. BigQuery stores data in different formats including STRING (text values), INTEGER (whole numbers), FLOAT (decimal numbers), and RECORD (fields containing other fields). Users can view the data structure by clicking on the Schema tab and preview actual data to understand how events are recorded. BigQuery operates on a usage-based pricing model with a free tier: storage is free for up to 10GiB per month with subsequent data charged at $0.02 per GiB ($0.023 in the Seoul region), while query usage is free for up to 1TiB per month with additional usage billed at $6.25 per TiB ($7.5 in the Seoul region). To extract specific data, users create SQL queries and can check the estimated data usage before execution. After running queries, results can be exported in various formats including CSV and Google Sheets. It's important to note that BigQuery only stores GA4 data from the point of connection forward, so businesses seeking to maximize their data collection and analysis capabilities should connect their GA4 properties to BigQuery as soon as possible rather than waiting.

- url: https://osoma.kr/blog/ga4-internal-traffic-filtering
  description: |
    Google Analytics 4 (GA4) features a fundamentally different approach to internal traffic filtering compared to Universal Analytics (UA), reflecting GA4's event-based data collection model. In GA4, internal traffic filtering follows a two-step process that requires both defining internal traffic sources and configuring filter settings. The filtering mechanism works by adding parameter values to events originating from internal sources and then processing these tagged events according to filter settings. When internal traffic is properly defined, GA4 automatically appends a 'traffic_type: internal' parameter to all events originating from the specified IP addresses, enabling the system to identify internal traffic. The internal traffic filtering process consists of three key components: defining internal traffic (specifying company IP addresses), identifying this traffic through event parameters, and setting the data filter status to determine how identified internal traffic should be handled. GA4 provides three filter status options: Test (the default setting, where filtered data remains visible in reports but can be segmented using dimensions), Active (where filtered data is permanently excluded from reports), and Inactive (where filtering is disabled). To implement internal traffic filtering, users must first define internal traffic by navigating to Admin > Property > Data Streams > Select Domain > Web Stream Details > Configure Tag Settings > Show All > Define Internal Traffic > Create, where they can add IP addresses to identify company traffic. After defining internal traffic, users should check the data filter settings under Admin > Property > Data Settings > Data Filters, where an Internal Traffic filter is already pre-created with a default 'Test' status. Before activating the filter permanently, users should test its functionality using either GA4 Debug View (by checking if events contain the 'traffic_type: internal' parameter) or the Real-time report (by adding a comparison with the test data filter dimension). Once testing confirms proper functioning, users can activate the filter to permanently exclude internal traffic from reports by changing the filter status from 'Test' to 'Active'. GA4 also offers a Developer Traffic filter that works similarly but doesn't require the manual definition step, as GA4 automatically adds 'debug_mode' and 'debug_event' parameters to events generated during debug mode. An important consideration when using internal traffic filtering is that activating the Internal Traffic filter will prevent viewing events in Debug View from defined internal IP addresses, as developer traffic automatically includes the 'traffic_type: internal' parameter. To work around this limitation, some users maintain the filter in Test status, create separate testing properties, or use Google Tag Manager lookup tables to modify the parameter values during preview mode.

  description: |
    Google Signals is a feature that enhances the accuracy and depth of Google Analytics 4 (GA4) data by connecting website and app session data from users who are logged into Google accounts and have enabled ad personalization. This functionality, introduced as a beta feature in July 2018 and officially released with GA4 in October 2020, allows businesses to access Google's first-party user activity data collected from various Google services like Chrome, YouTube, and Gmail. When Google Signals is activated, GA4 gains several important capabilities that improve marketing analytics and campaign effectiveness: cross-platform reporting that recognizes the same user across multiple devices (smartphones, desktops, tablets) even without site login, demographic and interest data about site visitors, enhanced remarketing capabilities, and improved advertising reports. The data collection works through Google's opt-out approach, where ad personalization is enabled by default in Google accounts unless users explicitly disable it through their account settings. Google Signals data works alongside other user identification methods in GA4, with a clear priority hierarchy: User-ID (highest priority, requiring site login), Google Signals data (second priority, for Google-logged-in users with ad personalization enabled), Device-ID (third priority, using cookies), and modeling (lowest priority, estimating user behavior when other identifiers aren't available). As privacy regulations tighten globally, Google has implemented data thresholds in GA4 reports to prevent identification of individual users based on demographic, interest, or other signal data. These thresholds cause certain data to be hidden or removed from reports when user counts are low within specified time periods, particularly when Google Signals is enabled or when device-based reporting contains insufficient user volumes. This threshold application often results in data appearing to be missing from reports despite being collected, indicated by a "threshold applied" warning message in the GA4 dashboard. To access data that's hidden due to thresholds, analysts can: use BigQuery for more comprehensive data analysis (recommended), temporarily switch the Reporting ID to device-based identification (which doesn't use Google Signals and thus avoids thresholds), or disable Google Signals collection entirely (not recommended as it permanently loses valuable demographic and cross-device data). Google Signals data has certain limitations due to its aggregated, anonymized nature - it cannot be exported to BigQuery, used in dashboards, custom reports, custom tables, User ID views, segments, daily/hourly data processing, mobile app properties, the Reporting API, Looker Studio, or smart lists. As privacy concerns grow and regulations like GDPR become stricter, some critics question Google's opt-out approach to data collection, suggesting Google Signals may eventually be required to follow an opt-in model or might be restricted under future privacy regulations. The evolving privacy landscape continues to create challenges for analytics tools like GA4, requiring businesses to stay informed about international privacy regulations while adapting their data analysis strategies.

  description: |
    Google Analytics 4 dimensions and metrics understanding is critical for optimizing business performance as they form the foundation of all GA4 reports. The article explains that dimensions represent data attributes (like city, country, or age) that segment your data, while metrics are quantitative measurements (like session count, event count, or conversions) that provide values for each dimension. Understanding these concepts is essential for properly configuring and utilizing GA4 reports to improve business outcomes. A common problem occurs when custom events and parameters are properly implemented through Google Tag Manager but fail to appear in GA4 reports, which happens because custom dimensions and metrics must be explicitly created to display these parameters. The article details how GA4 provides both standard (default) dimensions/metrics that are automatically collected and custom dimensions/metrics that must be defined to capture custom event parameters. For e-commerce tracking, GA4 offers specific dimensions and metrics related to product views, cart additions, checkouts, and purchases that help optimize the conversion funnel. These dimensions include item_name, item_id, item_brand, and item_category, while metrics include items viewed, items added to cart, and purchased items. There are limits to custom dimensions and metrics in the free version of GA4: 50 event-scoped custom dimensions, 25 user-scoped custom dimensions, and 50 custom metrics. The article provides step-by-step instructions for creating both event-scoped and user-scoped custom dimensions, emphasizing the importance of proper naming and descriptions for team collaboration and knowledge transfer. By properly understanding and implementing dimensions and metrics, marketers can more effectively analyze user behavior, optimize conversion funnels, track marketing campaign performance, and improve overall business results.

    Open Source Marketing's GA4/Amplitude payment tracking service for e-commerce platforms addresses a critical business performance challenge related to accurate conversion tracking for simplified payment methods like Naver Pay. According to data from the Bank of Korea, fintech companies' simplified payment services accounted for 67.2% of all card-based simplified payments in the first half of 2023, demonstrating their significant market penetration. While these payment methods offer consumers streamlined checkout processes and membership benefits, they create a major analytics challenge for businesses: the inability to accurately track purchase conversions at the precise moment of completion. This occurs because simplified payment methods redirect users to external sites like Naver for payment processing, making it difficult to collect complete purchase data with standard analytics implementations. The tracking limitation is especially problematic for rental mall platforms with restricted script modification capabilities, forcing businesses to track button clicks rather than actual purchase completions. Open Source Marketing's tracking service solves this problem by enabling accurate tracking of simplified payments at the actual completion point rather than just button clicks, providing detailed product information for items purchased through simplified payment methods, and maintaining proper attribution of source/medium/campaign data for purchases made through these payment gateways. This solution helps e-commerce businesses optimize their sales funnels by providing accurate conversion data, improving marketing campaign measurement, and gaining better visibility into actual customer purchase behavior, ultimately leading to more effective marketing strategies and increased sales performance. The service is specifically available for MakeShop and Cafe24 shopping mall platforms.

  description: |
    Google Analytics 4 user properties are essential for improving business performance by enabling targeted analysis and segmentation of user behavior. User properties represent user characteristics like membership level, occupation, subscription status, and purchasing behavior, which can be used to categorize users and analyze specific user groups across various reports. Unlike standard dimensions automatically collected by GA4 (such as age, device brand, gender, and browser), custom user properties must be manually defined and implemented to capture business-specific user attributes. Implementing user properties requires two key steps: configuring data transmission to GA4 either through Google Tag Manager or direct gtag code implementation, and setting up custom user dimensions within GA4. Once properly configured, user properties significantly enhance analytics capabilities by allowing comparison of different user groups in standard reports, adding secondary dimensions to acquisition reports to identify high-value traffic sources, creating segments for exploration reports, and serving as segmentation criteria in cohort and funnel analysis reports. For example, marketers can identify which acquisition channels deliver the most engaged professional users by segmenting traffic by occupation, or determine which initial traffic sources brought in users who later became high-value customers. These insights help optimize marketing campaigns, improve conversion funnels, and increase ROI by focusing efforts on channels and strategies that attract quality users most likely to convert and remain loyal. It's important to plan user properties during the event definition process and begin collecting this data as early as possible, as GA4 only captures data from the point of implementation forward.

  description: |
    Digital advertising targeting methods and their future amidst privacy regulations is a critical business performance topic that marketers must understand to optimize their strategies. The article explains that digital advertising operates through two primary targeting approaches: content targeting (based on the platform where ads appear) and audience targeting (based on user characteristics). Content targeting includes topic targeting, keyword targeting, and placement targeting, which focus on the context of where ads appear rather than user data. Audience targeting, meanwhile, relies on user interests, purchase intent, demographics, and first-party data (retargeting), which involves collecting personal identifiers and tracking user behavior. The increasing focus on privacy regulations, exemplified by the European Data Protection Board's potential prohibition of Meta's personalized advertising consent mechanism, creates significant challenges for audience targeting methods. To maintain effective advertising in this changing landscape, businesses should consider two key strategies: developing more targeted content that resonates with specific customer segments through testing and optimization, and emphasizing the benefits users receive when they consent to data sharing. Research shows that 74% of users are willing to share information like interests and demographics if it improves their shopping experience, and 71% don't mind sharing email addresses for personalized experiences. This indicates that clearly communicating the value exchange to customers can help maintain targeting effectiveness even as privacy regulations tighten. By focusing on creating compelling, segment-specific content while transparently highlighting the benefits of personalization, marketers can adapt to privacy-focused changes while still delivering effective targeted advertising that drives business results.

    Google Analytics 4's report sharing functionality, particularly the email scheduling feature, significantly improves business performance analysis by automating report delivery and preserving complex report configurations. This feature solves a common pain point where users previously had to recreate comparison reports or apply filters each time they accessed GA4. The email scheduling capability allows users to automatically receive reports on a predetermined schedule with all customizations (date ranges, comparisons, and filters) preserved, eliminating repetitive setup work and ensuring consistent data monitoring.

    When setting up scheduled emails, users can customize several important elements:
    - Report details: Name (which appears in the email subject line), description, and recipient list (limited to users with access to the GA4 property)
    - Schedule details: Start date (recommended to allow 72 hours for data processing), frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly), duration (1-12 months), and report format (PDF or CSV)
    
    The system can accommodate up to 50 scheduled emails per property, and recipients receive emails containing a "View Report" button for direct access to the report, along with the specified attachment format. Scheduled emails can be managed through the Admin > Property > Scheduled emails menu, where users can edit settings or delete schedules as needed.
    
    GA4 also provides status indicators for scheduled reports, including Active, Scheduled, Expired, No recipient, Report removed, Report invalid, and Creator invalid, helping users maintain effective reporting workflows. This feature is particularly valuable for teams who need regular data monitoring without requiring technical GA4 expertise from all stakeholders, making it easier to maintain consistent business performance tracking and analysis.

  description: |
    I'll analyze Google Analytics 4 (GA4) attribution analysis to explain how it helps improve business performance tracking and optimization.
    
    GA4's attribution analysis is a powerful feature that helps marketers understand how different marketing channels contribute to conversions when customers interact with multiple touchpoints before converting. This is crucial for optimizing marketing spend and strategy in today's complex customer journey.
    
    GA4 offers seven attribution models to analyze conversion paths:
    
    1. Cross-channel last click: Gives 100% credit to the last non-direct channel before conversion
    2. Cross-channel first click: Gives 100% credit to the first non-direct channel in the conversion path
    3. Cross-channel linear: Distributes credit equally across all non-direct channels in the path
    4. Cross-channel time decay: Gives more credit to channels closer to conversion with a 7-day half-life
    5. Cross-channel position-based: Gives 40% credit to first and last channels, with 20% distributed among middle touchpoints
    6. Ads-preferred last click: Gives 100% credit to the last Google Ads interaction, or follows last-click model if no Google Ads interaction exists
    7. Data-driven: Uses machine learning to analyze conversion patterns and allocate credit based on actual contribution
    
    A key feature across all GA4 attribution models is that direct traffic is excluded from receiving attribution credit unless the entire conversion path consists only of direct visits. This provides more accurate measurement by crediting the marketing channels that actually drove discovery and engagement.
    
    The data-driven model is particularly valuable as privacy regulations increase, using machine learning to analyze factors like:
    - Conversion and non-conversion paths
    - Time between clicks and conversions
    - Device types
    - Number of ad interactions
    - Ad exposure order
    - Ad asset types
    
    GA4 provides two main reports for attribution analysis:
    - Model comparison report: Compares conversion data between two attribution models to identify undervalued campaigns
    - Conversion paths report: Shows how different touchpoints contribute across the customer journey with visualizations of early, mid, and late touchpoints
    
    When using these reports, it's important to remember that attribution has limitations. Since GA4 relies on cookies or app instance IDs to track conversion paths, interactions across different devices or browsers (including in-app browsers from social media apps) may not be connected unless User ID is implemented.
    
    For optimal business results, GA4 attribution data should be used as a reference point for marketing decisions rather than absolute truth, helping marketers better understand channel effectiveness and optimize their marketing mix accordingly.
